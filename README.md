Covid Detection Using X rays
This is a web app for detecting covid 19 from X-rays of patients. It uses a Convolutional Neural Network (transfer learning from Resnet-50) to classify images as covid and normal.
The user just has to upload the image of the X-ray and the app will predict if it detects the presence of covid or not. 

Warning: This is just a fun project and should not be used for diagnosis purpose.
